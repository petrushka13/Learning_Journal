# Learning Activities
This week, I focused on two main learning tasks:  
- Watching the *WordPress Workflows* learning resource, which provided a helpful introduction to WordPress. This will be beneficial for the upcoming practical assignment that involves building a site using WordPress.  
- Starting to work with Joomla CMS by creating a basic website, helping me begin work on Assignment 1.

# Estimated Hours  
I dedicated approximately 4.5 hours to learning this week—around 2 hours for the LinkedIn learning course and 2.5 hours exploring Joomla CMS.  

# Content Insights
Most of my learning this week came not from traditional research but through hands-on experimentation using Joomla CMS and the Cloud Access Platform. Due to limited time, I only gained a partial understanding of building a Joomla site, but I was still able to grasp key concepts. While the site I created was fairly simple and close to the default template, I now realize how customizing layouts or using templates from online sources is essential for making a website stand out and fulfill its purpose. I also learned how Joomla structures content through articles, categories, modules, and menus—somewhat similar to the block-based structure in WordPress.  

# Career / Employability / Learning Insights  
Working with Joomla gave me a better understanding of how CMS platforms assist developers in building and enhancing websites. Using pre-built modules and sections made me reflect on why certain features, like login systems or breadcrumbs, are commonly included in many CMSs—they’re versatile and help a site achieve its goals. Moving forward, I’ll be more intentional about incorporating such features into future projects to improve functionality and user experience.
