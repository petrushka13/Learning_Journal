# Learning Activities
- This week, I watched the *WordPress Workflows* video, which introduced key features and advantages of WordPress. This content is particularly useful for the upcoming first assignment.  
- I also spent time working with the WordPress CMS to gain hands-on experience in preparation for creating a local website for the assignment submission.

# Estimated Hours  
I dedicated around 2 hours to learning this week—approximately one hour for the learning video and another hour exploring WordPress directly.

# Content Insights 
I learned that to deploy WordPress on a live server, you need a domain name, storage for the WordPress files, and a database. This helped me better understand the role CMS platforms play in website deployment. WordPress simplifies content creation and publishing, and it’s more efficient to write content directly in WordPress rather than copying it from another program, which can cause formatting issues.  

I also discovered the concept of child themes, which let you build on an existing theme by modifying only the parts you want. This is especially useful for quickly launching a site while maintaining flexibility in customization. WordPress's block-based structure makes it intuitive to organize content, allowing important elements to be easily highlighted in line with the site’s goals.  

Additionally, working with a local installation of WordPress is beneficial because it allows you to develop offline without needing an internet connection.

# Career / Employability / Learning Insights 
This week’s learning built on the foundation I’ve developed in previous weeks. Getting hands-on with WordPress made the platform feel more familiar and user-friendly, thanks to the learning materials I had already reviewed. However, I realized that I’ve started falling behind, and rushing through the tasks has impacted the quality of my learning. To properly understand how to build a site locally for the assignment, I’ll need to commit to watching more tutorials and diving deeper into the practical elements in the coming week.
