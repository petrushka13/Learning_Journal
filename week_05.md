The process of learning and applying Child Themes in WordPress proved to be highly beneficial. Utilizing a Child Theme eliminates the need to build an entire theme from scratch; instead, one can make targeted changes by creating additional CSS files and modifying functions.php. While this concept wasn't entirely new to me, thanks to prior experience in Web Design and Development, I delved deeper during this week's activities.

In practical terms, I experimented with various customizations, such as altering the background color, customizing the header.
