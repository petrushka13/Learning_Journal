# Week 06 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on practicing PHP by creating a small project that demonstrated key concepts like echoing HTML, conditional statements, loops, functions, and including files. I used simple tasks to build a two-page website with a reusable header and footer. The practical nature of the exercise made it easier to grasp PHP concepts in a hands-on manner.

Resources used:

Official PHP Documentation (https://www.php.net/docs.php)

Online PHP tutorials and examples for additional reference

Local XAMPP setup for testing PHP files

## Estimated Hours

Around 2 hours

## Content Insights

Echoing HTML: I practiced using echo to print various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. This demonstrated how PHP can dynamically generate webpage content.

Conditional Statements: By creating a time-based greeting using if/else statements, I learned how PHP can personalize content.

Loops: Implementing for, while, and foreach loops gave me a deeper understanding of how to handle repetitive tasks.

Functions: Writing a function to greet the user using parameters helped reinforce the importance of reusable code.

Include Files: Using include for the header and footer made my code cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Understanding PHP is essential for backend web development, and these skills are applicable in creating dynamic web pages and managing server-side logic.

The practice of breaking a project into smaller, manageable tasks is a valuable skill for real-world projects.

Working with includes and functions introduced me to code reusability, which is a best practice in programming.

I gained confidence in troubleshooting PHP errors through testing and debugging, which enhances problem-solving skills.

This knowledge will be helpful if I choose to work on freelance web development projects or backend roles in the future.
