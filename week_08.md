### Estimated Hours
I spent around 2 hours watching videos and tutorials. My group and I spent more than 6 hours working on our project. I spent another 2 hours doing my learning experiments.


### Content Insights
 I think searching and learning from documents is much better than only googleing videos and tutorials. As technology evolves rapidly, being adaptable is essential. My willingness to explore different learning methods demonstrates my openness to change and growth. Keep experimenting and adapting to stay ahead in my career.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
My experiment highlighted the value of self-directed learning. By actively seeking out and engaging with documentation, I enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This skill is highly transferable to any technical role.The ability to find answers independently is a crucial skill in the tech industry. Document-based learning allows me to explore beyond tutorials and videos, empowering me to tackle real-world challenges effectively.

## Learning experiment

### Hypothesis:
My hypothesis was that learning and searching through documents on my own before watching tutorials and videos would improve my understanding and ability to find solutions.

**Test Design**:

1.  Before watching any videos or tutorials, I searched the PHP documentation and WordPress support to create a PHP homepage and integrate it with WordPress.
2.  Next, I watched relevant videos and tutorials to gain new knowledge.
3.  Finally, I compared the work I did this week with the work I did in Week 7 to assess whether self-learning improved my understanding of PHP development.

**Analysis**:

After comparing the results between the two weeks, I think searching and learning from documents is better than only googleing videos and tutorials. More parts are considered and problems can be solved more quickly by reading document.

**Conclusion**:
Based on this experiment, I conclude that self-directed learning through documentation enhances understanding and problem-solving abilities. It’s a valuable approach for anyone seeking to improve their skills in PHP development.
